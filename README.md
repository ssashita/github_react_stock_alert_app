# react_stock_alert_app
Minimalist React and Material-UI PWA (Progressive Web App) for setting Stock alerts and getting alert  notifications

## Overview
As the description above says, this uses a minimal set of features and ideas of React app programming alongwith the React Material UI module, in order to create a Web app for setting, displaying and deleting stock alerts, and alerting the user with Browser notification when the alert condition is met. Currently, the app supports only Stock price based alerts. The back end server code for this app is not included in this codebase. The app is configured to use a service worker which is connected to a messaging server based on the MQTT protocol. Again, the MQTT server code is not part of this codebase. When the user sets an alert, the service worker subscribes to the relevant topic corresponding to this alert with the MQTT server. When the stock price condition mentioned in the alert is met, the server publishes a message to the alert topic in the MQTT server (this is in the back end and not part of this codebase), and the subscribed service worker on this web client receives that message, in response to which it requests the browser to show a notification about the alert.
